Hello and welcome to my Scratch game 'Mario Wars Hide n Seek'. 
I made this game for a computer science course I am taking with Hardvard called CS50x.
Our First project was to use Scratch (an interactive computer language) to create a story or game.
I chose the latter and created the game below.

Controls : 

          Space = Jump
          Left arrow = Move left
          Right arrow = Move right
          
Good luck and have fun! It won't take long :)
