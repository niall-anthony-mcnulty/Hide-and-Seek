Hello and welcome to my Scratch game 'Mario Wars Hide n Seek'. Click the URL on the repo homepage to play.
I made this game for a computer science course I am taking with Hardvard called CS50x.

          Space = Jump
          Left arrow = Move left
          Right arrow = Move right
          
Good luck and have fun! It won't take long :)
